Abstract
This paper concerns the introduction of a new Markov Chain Monte Carlo scheme for posterior sampling in Bayesian nonparametric mixture models with priors that belong to the general Poisson-Kingman class. We present a novel compact way of representing the infinite dimensional component of the model such that while explicitly representing this infinite component it has less memory and storage requirements than previous MCMC schemes. We describe comparative simulation results demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed MCMC algorithm against existing marginal and conditional MCMC samplers.
1 Introduction
According to Ghahramani [9], models that have a nonparametric component give us more flexiblity that could lead to better predictive performance. This is because their capacity to learn does not saturate hence their predictions should continue to improve as we get more and more data. Furthermore, we are able to fully consider our uncertainty about predictions thanks to the Bayesian paradigm. However, a major impediment to the widespread use of Bayesian nonparametric models is the problem of inference. Over the years, many MCMC methods have been proposed to perform inference which usually rely on a tailored representation of the underlying process [5, 4, 18, 20, 28, 6]. This is an active research area since dealing with this infinite dimensional component forbids the direct use of standard simulation-based methods for posterior inference. These methods usually require a finite-dimensional representation. There are two main sampling approaches to facilitate simulation in the case of Bayesian nonparametric models: random truncation and marginalization. These two schemes are known in the literature as conditional and marginal samplers.
In conditional samplers, the infinite-dimensional prior is replaced by a finite-dimensional representation chosen according to a truncation level. In marginal samplers, the need to represent the infinite-dimensional component can be bypassed by marginalising it out. Marginal samplers have less storage requirements than conditional samplers but could potentially have worst mixing properties. However, not integrating out the infinite dimensional compnent leads to a more comprehensive representation of the random probability measure, useful to compute expectations of interest with respect to the posterior.
In this paper, we propose a novel MCMC sampler for Poisson-Kingman mixture models, a very large class of Bayesian nonparametric mixture models that encompass all previously explored ones in the literature. Our approach is based on a hybrid scheme that combines the main strengths of
1

both conditional and marginal samplers. In the flavour of probabilistic programming, we view our contribution as a step towards wider usage of flexible Bayesian nonparametric models, as it allows automated inference in probabilistic programs built out of a wide variety of Bayesian nonparametric building blocks.

2 Poisson-Kingman processes

Poisson-Kingman random probability measures (RPMs) have been introduced in Pitman [23] as a
generalization of homogeneous Normalized Random Measures (NRMs) [25, 13]. Let X be a complete and separable metric space endowed with the Borel -field BpXq, let   CRMp, H0q be a homogeneous Completely Random Measure (CRM) with Levy measure  and base distribution H0, see Kingman [15] for a good overview about CRMs and references therein. Then, the corresponding
total mass of  is T " pXq and let it be finite, positive almost surely, and absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure. For any t P R, let us consider the conditional distribution of {t given that the total mass T P dt. This distribution is denoted by PKp, t, H0q, it is the distribution of a RPM, where t denotes the usual Dirac delta function. Poisson-Kingman RPMs form a class of RPMs whose distributions are obtained by mixing PKp, t, H0q, over t, with respect to some distribution  on the positive real line. Specifically, a Poisson-Kingman RPM has following
the hierarchical representation

T  P |T " t  PKp, t, H0q.

(1)

The RPM P is referred to as the Poisson-Kingman RPM with Levy measure , base distribution H0

and mixing distribution . Throughout the paper we denote by PKp, , H0q the distribution of P

and, without loss of generality, we will assume that pdtq9hptqfptqdt where f is the density of

the total mass T under the CRM and h is a non-negative function. Note that, when pdtq " fptqdt

then the distribution PKp, f, H0q coincides with NRMp, H0q.

The resulting P

"

is almost surely discrete and since  is homogeneous, the atoms pkqk1 of P are independent of

their masses ppkqk1 and form a sequence of independent random variables identically distributed

according to H0. Finally, the masses of P have distribution governed by the Levy measure  and

the distribution .

One nice property is that P is almost surely discrete: if we obtain a sample tYiuni"1 from it, there is a positive probability of Yi " Yj for each pair of indexes i  j. Hence, it induces a random partition  on N, where i and j are in the same block in  if and only if Yi " Yj. Kingman [16] showed that  is exchangeable, this property will be one of the main tools for the derivation of our hybrid
sampler.

2.1 Size-biased sampling Poisson-Kingman processes

A second object induced by a Poisson-Kingman RPM is a size-biased permutation of its atoms.

Specifically, order the blocks in  by increasing order of the least element in each block, and for

each k P N let Zk be the least element of the kth block. Zk is the index among pYiqi1 of the

first appearance of the kth unique value in the sequence. Let Jk " ptYZk uq be the mass of the

corresponding atom in . Then pJkqk1 is a size-biased permutation of the masses of atoms in ,

that the sequence can be understood as a stick-breaking construction: starting with a stick of length

T0 " T ; break off the first piece of length J1; the surplus length of stick is T1 " T0  J1; then the second piece with length J2 is broken off, etc.

Theorem 2.1 of Perman et al. [21] states that the sequence of surplus masses pTkqk0 forms a Markov chain and gives the corresponding initial distribution and transition kernels. The corre-
sponding generative process for the sequence pYiqi1 is as follows:

i) Start with drawing the total mass from its distribution P,h,H0 pT P dtq9hptqfptqdt.
ii) The first draw Y1 from P is a size-biased pick from the masses of . The actual value of Y1 is simply Y1  H0, while the mass of the corresponding atom in  is J1, with conditional

iii) For subsequent draws i  2:

where pckqkPrKs denotes a particular partition of rns with K blocks, c1, . . . , cK , ordered by increasing least element and |ck| is the cardinality of block ck. The distribution (2) is invariant to the size-biased order. Such a joint distribution was first obtained in Pitman [23] , see also Pitman [24]
for further details.

2.2 Relationship to the usual Stick-breaking construction

In the generative process above, we mentioned that it is reminiscent of the well known stick breaking

construction from Ishwaran & James [12], where you break a stick of length one but it is not the

same. However, we can effectively reparameterize the model, starting with Equation (2), due to

two useful identities in distribution:

Pj

d
"

Jj T  j J

and Vj

d
"

Pj 1 j P

for j " 1, . . . , K.

Indeed, using this reparameterization, we obtain the corresponding joint in terms of K p0, 1q-valued

stick-breaking weights tVjuKj"1 which correspond to a stick-breaking representation. Note that this joint distribution is for a general Levy measure , density f and it is conditioned on the valued
of the random variable T . We can recover the well known Stick breaking representations for the

Dirichlet and Pitman-Yor processes, for a specific choice of  and if we integrate out T , see the

supplementary material for further details about the latter. However, in general, these stick-breaking

random variables form a sequence of dependent random variables with a complicated distribution,

except for the two previously mentioned processes, see Pitman [22] for details.

2.3 Poisson-Kingman mixture model
We are mainly interested in using Poisson-Kingman RPMs as a building block for an infinite mixture model. Indeed, we can use Equation (1) as the top level of the following hierarchical specification

where F p | Y q is the likelihood term for each mixture component, and our dataset consists of n observations pxiqiPrns of the corresponding variables pXiqiPrns. We will assume that F p | Y q is smooth. After specifying the model we would like to carry out inference for clustering and/or density estimation tasks. We can do it exactly and more efficiently than with known MCMC samplers with our novel approach. In the next section, we present our main contribution and in the following one we show how it outperforms other samplers.
3 Hybrid Sampler

Equation's (2) joint distribution is written in terms of the first K size-biased weights. In order to obtain a complete representation of the RPM, we need to size-bias sample from it a countably infinite number of times. Succesively, devise some way of representing this object exactly in a computer with finite memory and storage is needed.

We introduce the following novel strategy: starting from equation (2), we exploit the generative

process of section 2.1 when reassigning observations to clusters. In addition to this, we reparame-

terize the model in terms of a surplus mass random variable V

For this reason, while having a complete representation of the infinite dimensional part of the model we only need to explicitly represent those size-biased weights associated to occupied clusters plus a surplus mass term which is associated to the rest of the empty clusters, as Figure 1 shows. The cluster reassignment step can be seen as a lazy sampling scheme: we explicitly represent and update the weights associated to occupied clusters and create a size-biased weight only when a new cluster appears. To make this possible we use the induced partition and we call Equation (4) the varying table size Chinese restaurant representation because the size-biased weights can be thought as the sizes of the tables in our restaurant. In the next subsection, we compute the complete conditionals of each random variable of interest to implement an overall Gibbs sampling MCMC scheme.

According to the rule above, the ith observation will be either reassigned to an existing cluster or to one of the M new clusters in the ReUse algorithm as in Favaro & Teh [6]. If it is assigned to a new cluster, then we need to sample a new size-biased weight from the following

Every time a new cluster is created we need to obtain its corresponding size-biased weight which could happen 1  R  n times per iteration hence, it has a significant contribution to the overall computational cost. For this reason, an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) draw from
its corresponding complete conditional (6) is highly desirable. In the next subsection we present a way to achieve this. Finally, for updating cluster parameters tYkukPrKs, in the case where H0 is non-conjugate to the likelihood, we use an extension of Favaro & Teh [6]'s ReUse algorithm, see
Algorithm 3 in the supplementary material for details.

The complete conditionals in Equation (5) do not have a standard form but a generic MCMC method can be applied to sample from each within the Gibbs sampler. We use slice sampling from Neal [19] to update the size-biased weights and the surplus mass. However, there is a class of priors where the total mass's density is intractable so an additional step needs to be introduced to sample the surplus mass. In the next subsection we present two alternative ways to overcome this issue.

3.2 Example of classes of Poisson-Kingman priors

This

is

denoted

by

where

h

is a function that indexes each member of the class. For example, in the experimental section, we

picked 3 choices of the h function that index the following processes: Pitman-Yor, Normalized Sta-

ble and Normalized Generalized Gamma processes. This class includes all Gibbs type priors with

parameter  P p0, 1q, so other choices of h are possible, see Gnedin & Pitman [10] and De Blasi

et al. [1] for a noteworthy account of this class of Bayesian nonparametric priors. In this case, the

total mass's density is intractable and we propose two ways of dealing with this. Firstly, we used

Kanter [14]'s integral representation for the -Stable density as in Lomeli et al. [17], introduce an

auxiliary variable Z and slice sample each variable

see Algorithm 1 in the supplementary material for details. Alternatively, we can completely bypass the evaluation of the total mass's density by updating the surplus mass with a Metropolis-Hastings step with an independent proposal from a Stable or from an Exponentially Tilted Stable(). It is straight forward to obtain i.i.d draws from these proposals, see Devroye [3] and Hofert [11] for an improved rejection sampling method for the Exponentially tilted case. This leads to the following acceptance ratio

Fortunately, we can get an i.i.d. draw from the above due to an identity in distribution given by

Favaro et al.

[8] for the usual stick breaking weights for any prior in this class such that  "

This class of RPMs generalises the

T is ptq " fptq we recover the Levy measure and total mass's density function of a Gamma

process. Finally, to sample a new size-biased weight

If b  1, this complete conditional is a monotone decreasing unnormalised density with maximum at b. We can easily get an i.i.d. draw with a simple rejection sampler [2] where the rejection constant is bv and the proposal is U p0, vq. There is no other known sampler for this process.

3.3 Relationship to marginal and conditional MCMC samplers
Starting from equation (2), another strategy would be to reparameterize the model in terms of the usual stick breaking weights. Next, we could choose a random truncation level and represent finitely many sticks as in Favaro & Walker [7]. Alternatively, we could integrate out the random probability measure and sample only the partition induced by it as in Lomeli et al. [17]. Conditional samplers have large memory requirements as often, the number of sticks needed can be very large. Furthermore, the conditional distributions of the stick lengths are quite involved so they tend to have slow running times. Marginal samplers have less storage requirements than conditional samplers but could potentially have worst mixing properties. For example, Lomeli et al. [17] had to introduce a number of auxiliary variables which worsen the mixing.
Our novel hybrid sampler exploits marginal and conditional samplers advantages. It has less memory requirements since it just represents the size-biased weights of occupied as opposed to conditional samplers which represent both empty and occupied clusters. Also, it does not integrate out the size-biased weights thus, we obtain a more comprehensive representation of the RPM.

4 Performance assesssment

We illustrate the performance of our hybrid sampler on a range of Bayesian nonparametric mixture models, obtained by different specifications of  and , as in Equation (3). At the top level of this hierarchical specification, different Bayesian nonparametric priors were chosen from both classes presented in the examples section. We chose the base distribution H0 and the likelihood term F for the kth cluster to be

H0pdkq " N dk | 0, 02

and

F pdx1, . . . , dxnk

|

k, 1q

"

nk
i"1

N

xi

|

k, 12 ,

where tXjunj"k 1 are the nk observations assigned to the kth cluster at some iteration. N denotes a Normal distribution with mean k and variance 12, a common parameter among all clusters. The mean's prior distribution is Normal, centered at 0 and with variance 02. Although the base distribution is conjugate to the likelihood we treated it as non-conjugate case and sampled the parameters

at each iteration rather than integrating them out.

We used the dataset from Roeder [26] to test the algorithmic performance in terms of running time and effective sample size (ESS), as Table 1 shows. The dataset consists of measurements of velocities in km/sec of n " 82 galaxies from a survey of the Corona Borealis region. For the -Stable Poisson-Kingman class, we compared it against our implementation of Favaro & Walker [7]'s conditional sampler and against the marginal sampler of Lomeli et al. [17]. We chose to compare our hybrid sampler against these existing approaches which follow the same general purpose paradigm.

Table 1: Running times in seconds and ESS averaged over 10 chains, 30,000 iterations, 10,000 burn in.

Table 1 shows that different choices of  result in differences in the algorithm's running times and ESS. The reason for this is that in the  " 0.5 case there are readily available random number generators which do not increase the computational cost. In contrast, in the  " 0.3 case, a rejection sampler method is needed every time a new size-biased weight is sampled which increases the computational cost, see Favaro et al. [8] for details. Even so, in most cases, we outperform both marginal and conditional MCMC schemes in terms of running times and in all cases, in terms of ESS. In the Hybrid-MH case, even thought the ESS and running times are competitive, we found that the acceptance rate is not optimal, we are currently exploring other choices of proposals. Finally, in Example b), our approach is the only one available and it has good running times and ESS. This qualitative comparison confirms our previous statements about our novel approach.
5 Discussion
Our main contribution is our Hybrid MCMC sampler as a general purpose tool for inference with a very large class of infinite mixture models. We argue in favour of an approach in which a generic algorithm can be applied to a very large class of models, so that the modeller has a lot of flexibility in choosing specific models suitable for his/her problem of interest. Our method is a hybrid approach since it combines the perks of the conditional and marginal schemes. Indeed, our experiments confirm that our hybrid sampler is more efficient since it outperforms both marginal and conditional samplers in running times in most cases and in ESS in all cases.
We introduced a new compact way of representing the infinite dimensional component such that it is feasible to perform inference and how to deal with the corresponding intractabilities. However, there are still various challenges that remain when dealing with these type of models. For instance, there are some values for  which we are unable to perform inference with our novel sampler. Secondly, when a Metropolis-Hastings step is used, there could be other ways to improve the mixing in terms of better proposals. Finally, all BNP MCMC methods can be affected by the dimensionality and size of the dataset when dealing with an infinite mixture model. Indeed, all methods rely on the same way of dealing with the likelihood term. When adding a new cluster, all methods sample its
7

corresponding parameter from the prior distribution. In a high dimensional scenario, it could be very difficult to sample parameter values close to the existing data points. We consider these points to be an interesting avenue of future research.
