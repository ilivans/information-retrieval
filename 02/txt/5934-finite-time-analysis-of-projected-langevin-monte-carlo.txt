Abstract
We analyze the projected Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) algorithm, a close cousin of projected Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). We show that LMC allows to sample in polynomial time from a posterior distribution restricted to a convex body and with concave log-likelihood. This gives the first Markov chain to sample from a log-concave distribution with a first-order oracle, as the existing chains with provable guarantees (lattice walk, ball walk and hit-and-run) require a zerothorder oracle. Our proof uses elementary concepts from stochastic calculus which could be useful more generally to understand SGD and its variants.

1 Introduction
A fundamental primitive in Bayesian learning is the ability to sample from the posterior distribution. Similarly to the situation in optimization, convexity is a key property to obtain algorithms with provable guarantees for this task. Indeed several Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods have been analyzed for the case where the posterior distribution is supported on a convex set, and the negative log-likelihood is convex. This is usually referred to as the problem of sampling from a log-concave distribution. In this paper we propose and analyze a new Markov chain for this problem which could have several advantages over existing chains for machine learning applications. We describe formally our contribution in Section 1.1. Then in Section 1.2 we explain how this contribution relates to various line of work in different fields such as theoretical computer science, statistics, stochastic approximation, and machine learning.

1.1 Main result

Let K  Rn be a convex set such that 0  K, K contains a Euclidean ball of radius r > 0 and is contained in a Euclidean ball of radius R. Denote PK the Euclidean projection on K (i.e., PK (x) = argminyK |x - y| where | * | denotes the Euclidean norm in Rn), and * K the gauge of K defined by
x K = inf{t  0; x  tK}, x  Rn.
Let f : K  R be a L-Lipschitz and -smooth convex function, that is f is differentiable and satisfies x, y  K, |f (x) - f (y)|  |x - y|, and |f (x)|  L. We are interested in the problem of sampling from the probability measure  on Rn whose density with respect to the Lebesgue
measure is given by:

d 1

= exp(-f (x))1{x  K}, where Z =

exp(-f (y))dy.

dx Z

We denote m = E|X|, and M = E [  K ], where  is uniform on the sphere Sn-1 = {x  Rn : |x| = 1}.

In this paper we study the following Markov chain, which depends on a parameter  > 0, and where 1, 2, . . . is an i.i.d. sequence of standard Gaussian random variables in Rn, and X0 = 0,

 Xk+1 = PK Xk - 2 f (Xk) + k .

(1)

We call the chain (1) projected Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC).

Recall that the total variation distance between two measures ,  is defined as TV(, ) = supA |(A) - (A)| where the supremum is over all measurable sets A. With a slight abuse of notation we sometimes write TV(X, ) where X is a random variable distributed according to
. The notation vn = O(un) (respectively ) means that there exists c  R, C > 0 such that vn  Cun logc(un) (respectively ).

Our main result shows that for an appropriately chosen step-size and number of iterations, one has convergence in total variation distance of the iterates (Xk) to the target distribution .

Note that by viewing , L, r as numerical constants, using M  1/r, and assuming R  n and m  n3/4, the bound reads
n9m6 N =  22 .
 Observe also that if f is constant, that is  is the uniform measure on K, then L = 0, m  n, and one can show that M = O(1/ n), which yields the bound:

N =

1.2 Context and related works
There is a long line of works in theoretical computer science proving results similar to Theorem 1, starting with the breakthough result of Dyer et al. [1991] who showed that the lattice walk mixes in O(n23) steps. The current record for the mixing time is obtained by Lovasz and Vempala [2007], who show a bound of O(n4) for the hit-and-run walk. These chains (as well as other popular chains such as the ball walk or the Dikin walk, see e.g. Kannan and Narayanan [2012] and references therein) all require a zeroth-order oracle for the potential f , that is given x one can calculate the value f (x). On the other hand our proposed chain (1) works with a first-order oracle, that is given x one can calculate the value of f (x). The difference between zeroth-order oracle and firstorder oracle has been extensively studied in the optimization literature (e.g., Nemirovski and Yudin [1983]), but it has been largely ignored in the literature on polynomial-time sampling algorithms. We also note that hit-and-run and LMC are the only chains which are rapidly mixing from any starting point (see Lovasz and Vempala [2006]), though they have this property for seemingly very different reasons. When initialized in a corner of the convex body, hit-and-run might take a long time to take a step, but once it moves it escapes very far (while a chain such as the ball walk would only do a small step). On the other hand LMC keeps moving at every step, even when initialized in a corner, thanks for the projection part of (1).
Our main motivation to study the chain (1) stems from its connection with the ubiquitous stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm. In general this algorithm takes the form xk+1 = PK (xk - f (xk) + k) where 1, 2, . . . is a centered i.i.d. sequence. Standard results in approximation theory, such as Robbins and Monro [1951], show that if the variance of the noise Var(1) is of smaller order than the step-size  then the iterates (xk) converge to the minimum of f on K (for a step-size decreasing sufficiently fast as a function of the number of iterations). For the specific noise

2

sequence that we study in (1), the variance is exactly equal to the step-size, which is why the chain deviates from its standard and well-understood behavior. We also note that other regimes where SGD does not converge to the minimum of f have been studied in the optimization literature, such as the constant step-size case investigated in Pflug [1986], Bach and Moulines [2013].
The chain (1) is also closely related to a line of works in Bayesian statistics on Langevin Monte Carlo algorithms, starting essentially with Tweedie and Roberts [1996]. The focus there is on the unconstrained case, that is K = Rn. In this simpler situation, a variant of Theorem 1 was proven in the recent paper Dalalyan [2014]. The latter result is the starting point of our work. A straightforward way to extend the analysis of Dalalyan to the constrained case is to run the unconstrained chain with an additional potential that diverges quickly as the distance from x to K increases. However it seems much more natural to study directly the chain (1). Unfortunately the techniques used in Dalalyan [2014] cannot deal with the singularities in the diffusion process which are introduced by the projection. As we explain in Section 1.3 our main contribution is to develop the appropriate machinery to study (1).
In the machine learning literature it was recently observed that Langevin Monte Carlo algorithms are particularly well-suited for large-scale applications because of the close connection to SGD. For instance Welling and Teh [2011] suggest to use mini-batch to compute approximate gradients instead of exact gradients in (1), and they call the resulting algorithm SGLD (Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics). It is conceivable that the techniques developed in this paper could be used to analyze SGLD and its refinements introduced in Ahn et al. [2012]. We leave this as an open problem for future work. Another interesting direction for future work is to improve the polynomial dependency on the dimension and the inverse accuracy in Theorem 1 (our main goal here was to provide the simplest polynomial-time analysis).

1.3 Contribution and paper organization

As we pointed out above, Dalalyan [2014] proves the equivalent of Theorem 1 in the unconstrained

case. His elegant approach is based on viewing LMC as a discretization of the diffusion process

dXt

=

dWt -

1 2

f (Xt),

where

(Wt)

is a Brownian motion.

The

analysis then proceeds in two

steps, by deriving first the mixing time of the diffusion process, and then showing that the discretized

process is `close' to its continuous version. In Dalalyan [2014] the first step is particularly trans-

parent as he assumes -strong convexity for the potential f , which in turns directly gives a mixing

time of order 1/. The second step is also simple once one realizes that LMC (without projection)

can

be

viewed

as

process

dWt

1 2

f

(X

t 

). Using Pinsker's inequality and

Girsanov's formula it is then a short calculation to show that the total variation distance between Xt

and Xt is small.

The constrained case presents several challenges, arising from the reflection of the diffusion pro-

cess on the boundary of K, and from the lack of curvature in the potential (indeed the constant

potential case is particularly important for us as it corresponds to  being the uniform distri-

bution on K). Rather than a simple Brownian motion with drift, LMC with projection can be

viewed as the discretization of reflected Brownian motion with drift, which is a process of the form

dXt

dWt -

f

(Xt

)dt

-

tL(dt),

where Xt



K, t



0, L is a measure supported on

{t  0 : Xt  K}, and t is an outer normal unit vector of K at Xt. The term tL(dt) is

referred to as the Tanaka drift. Following Dalalyan [2014] the analysis is again decomposed in two

steps. We study the mixing time of the continuous process via a simple coupling argument, which

crucially uses the convexity of K and of the potential f . The main difficulty is in showing that the

discretized process (Xt) is close to the continuous version (Xt), as the Tanaka drift prevents us

from a straightforward application of Girsanov's formula. Our approach around this issue is to first

use a geometric argument to prove that the two processes are close in Wasserstein distance, and then

to show that in fact for a reflected Brownian motion with drift one can deduce a total variation bound

from a Wasserstein bound.

In this extended abstract we focus on the special case where f is a constant function, that is  is uniform on the convex body K. The generalization to an arbitrary smooth potential can be found in the supplementary material. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 contains the main tehcnical arguments. We first remind the reader of Tanaka's construction (Tanaka [1979]) of reflected Brownian motion in Section 2.1. We present our geometric argument to bound the

3

Wasserstein distance between (Xt) and (Xt) in Section 2.2, and we use our coupling argument to bound the mixing time of (Xt) in Section 2.3. The derivation of a total variation bound from the Wasserstein bound is discussed in Section 2.4. Finally we conclude the paper in Section 3 with some
preliminary experimental comparison between LMC and hit-and-run.

2 The constant potential case

In this section we derive the main arguments to prove Theorem 1 when f is a constant function, that is f = 0. For a point x  K we say that  is an outer unit normal vector at x if || = 1 and
x - x ,   0, x  K.
For x / K we say that 0 is an outer unit normal at x. We define the support function hK of K by hK (y) = sup { x, y ; x  K} , y  Rn.
Note that hK is also the gauge function of the polar body of K.

2.1 The Skorokhod problem

Let T  R+  {+} and w : [0, T )  Rn be a piecewise continuous path with w(0)  K. We say that x : [0, T )  Rn and  : [0, T )  Rn solve the Skorokhod problem for w if one has x(t)  K, t  [0, T ),
x(t) = w(t) + (t), t  [0, T ),
and furthermore  is of the form
t
(t) = - s L(ds), t  [0, T ),
0
where s is an outer unit normal at x(s), and L is a measure on [0, T ] supported on the set {t  [0, T ) : x(t)  K}.

The path x is called the reflection of w at the boundary of K, and the measure L is called the local

time of x at the boundary of K. Skorokhod showed the existence of such a a pair (x, ) in dimension

1 in Skorokhod [1961], and Tanaka extended this result to convex sets in higher dimensions in

Tanaka [1979]. Furthermore Tanaka also showed that the solution is unique, and if w is continuous

then so is x and . In particular the reflected Brownian motion in K, denoted (Xt), is defined as the reflection of the standard Brownian motion (Wt) at the boundary of K (existence follows by continuity of Wt). Observe that by Ito's formula, for any smooth function g on Rn,

g(Xt) - g(X0) =

t
g(Xs), dWs

(2)

To get a sense of what a solution typically looks like, let us work out the case where w is piecewise
constant (this will also be useful to realize that LMC can be viewed as the solution to a Skorokhod problem). For a sequence g1 . . . gN  Rn, and for  > 0, we consider the path:

N
w(t) = gk 1{t  k},

t  [0, (N + 1)).

k=1

Define (xk)k=0,...,N inductively by x0 = 0 and

xk+1 = PK (xk + gk).

It is easy to verify that the solution to the Skorokhod problem for w is given by x(t) = x

2.2 Discretization of reflected Brownian motion

Given the discussion above, it is clear that when f is a constant function, the chain (1) can be viewed

as the reflection (Xt) of a discretized Brownian motion W t := W

t 

at the boundary of K (more

precisely the value of Xk coincides with the value of Xk as defined by (1)). It is rather clear that

the discretized Brownian motion (W t) is "close" to the path (Wt), and we would like to carry this

to the reflected paths (Xt) and (Xt). The following lemma extracted from Tanaka [1979] allows to

do exactly that.

Lemma 1 Let w and w be piecewise continuous path and assume that (x, ) and (x, ) solve the Skorokhod problems for w and w, respectively. Then for all time t we have
|x(t) - x(t)|2  |w(t) - w(t)|2
t
+ 2 w(t) - w(t) - w(s) + w(s), (ds) - (ds) .
0

Applying the above lemma to the processes (Wt) and (W t) at time T = N  yields (note that
WT = W T )
TT
|XT - XT |2  -2 Wt - W t, t L(dt) + 2 Wt - W t, t L(dt)
00
We claim that the second integral is equal to 0. Indeed, since the discretized process is constant on the intervals [k, (k + 1)) the local time L is a positive combination of Dirac point masses at

, 2, . . . , N .

On the other hand Wk = W k for all integer k, hence the claim. Therefore

T
|XT - XT |2  -2 Wt - W t, t L(dt)
0

Using the inequality x, y  x K hK (y) we get

T

|XT - XT |2  2 sup Wt - W T K hK (t) L(dt).

Taking the square root, expectation and using Cauchy-Schwarz we get

T

E |XT - XT | 2  2 E sup Wt - W T K E

hK (t) L(dt) .

[0,T ]

(3)

The next two lemmas deal with each term in the right hand side of the above equation, and they will

show that there exists a universal constant C such that

E |XT - XT |  C ( log(T /))1/4 n3/4 T 1/2 M 1/2.

(4)

We discuss why the above bound implies a total variation bound in Section 2.4.

Lemma 2 We have, for all t > 0 E

2

Proof By Ito's formula d|Xt|2 = 2 Xt, dWt + n dt - 2 Xt, t L(dt).
Now observe that by definition of the reflection, if t is in the support of L then
Xt, t  x, t , x  K.
In other words Xt, t  hK (t). Therefore
tt
2 hK (s) L(ds)  2 Xs, dWs + nt + |X0|2 - |Xt|2.

The first term of the right-hand side is a martingale, so using that X0 = 0 and taking expectation we get the result.

that since (Wt) is a martingale, the process Mt = Wt K is a sub-martingale. By Doob's maximal inequality

Y0 p = sup Mt p  2 M p,

2.3 A mixing time estimate for the reflected Brownian motion

Given a probability measure  supported on K, we let Pt be the law of Xt when X0 has law . The following lemma is the key result to estimate the mixing time of the process (Xt).

Lemma 4 Let x, x  K

TV(xPt, x

The above result clearly implies that for a probability measure  on K, TV(0Pt, Pt) 

K |x| (dx) . Since  (the uniform measure on K) is stationary for reflected Brownian motion, we
2t

obtain

TV(0Pt, )



m . 2t

(6)

In other words, starting from 0, the mixing time of (Xt) is of order m2. We now turn to the proof of the above lemma.

Proof The proof is based on a coupling argument. Let (Wt) be a Brownian motion starting from 0 and let (Xt) be a reflected Brownian motion starting from x:
X0 = x dXt = dWt - t L(dt)

6

where (t) and L satisfy the appropriate conditions. We construct a reflected Brownian motion (Xt)

starting from x as follows. reflection with respect to the

Let  = inf hyperplane

{t  0; Xt (Xt - Xt)

= Xt}, and . Then up to

for t time

<  let St be  , the process

the (Xt

orthogonal ) is defined

by

X0 = x dXt = dWt - t L (dt) dWt = St(dWt)

where L is a measure supported on {t   ; Xt  K}, and t is an outer unit normal at Xt for all such t. After time  we just set Xt = Xt. Since St is an orthogonal map (Wt ) is a Brownian motion and thus (Xt) is a reflected Brownian motion starting from x . Therefore

TV(xPt, x Pt)  P(Xt = Xt) = P( > t).

Observe that on [0,  )

dWt - dWt = (I - St)(dWt) = 2 Vt, dWt Vt,

where

Vt

=

.Xt -Xt
|Xt -Xt |

So

d(Xt - Xt) = 2 Vt, dWt Vt - t L(dt) + t L (dt) = 2(dBt) Vt - t L(dt) + t L (dt),

where

t

Bt = Vs, dWs , on [0,  ).
0

Observe that (Bt) is a one-dimensional Brownian motion. Ito's formula then gives

dg(Xt - Xt) = 2 g(Xt - Xt), Vt dBt - g(Xt - Xt), t L(dt) + g(Xt - Xt),  t L (dt) + 22g(Xt - Xt)(Vt, Vt) dt,
for every smooth function g on Rn. Now if g(x) = |x| then

g(Xt - Xt) = Vt

so g(Xt - Xt), Vt = 1, g(Xt - Xt), t  0 on the support of L, and g(Xt - Xt), t  0

on the support of L .

Moreover 2g(Xt - Xt) =

P1
|Xt-Yt| (Xt-Yt)

where

Px

denotes

the

orthogonal projection on x. In particular 2g(Xt - Yt)(Vt) = 0. We obtain |Xt - Xt| 

|x - x | + 2Bt, on [0,  ). Therefore P( > t)  P( > t) where  is the first time the Brownian

motion (Bt) hits the value -|x - x |/2. Now by the reflection principle

2.4 From Wasserstein distance to total variation
To conclude it remains to derive a total variation bound between XT and XT using (4). The details of this step are deferred to the supplementary material where we consider the case of a general logconcave distribution. The intuition goes as follows: the processes (XT +s)s0 and (XT +s)s0 both evolve according to a Brownian motion until the first time s that one process undergoes a reflection. But if T is large enough and  is small enough then one can easily get from (4) (and the fact that the uniform measure does not put too much mass close to the boundary) that XT and XT are much closer to each other than they are to the boundary of K. This implies that one can couple them (just as in Section 2.3) so that they meet before one of them hits the boundary.
3 Experiments
Comparing different Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms is a challenging problem in and of itself. Here we choose the following simple comparison procedure based on the volume algorithm
7

developed in Cousins and Vempala [2014]. This algorithm, whose objective is to compute the vol-
ume of a given convex set K, procedes in phases. In each phase it estimates the mean of a certain
function under a multivariate Gaussian restricted to K with (unrestricted) covariance  In. Cousins and Vempala provide a Matlab implementation of the entire algorithm, where in each phase the
target mean is estimated by sampling from the truncated Gaussian using the hit-and-run (H&R)
chain. We implemented the same procedure with LMC instead of H&R, and we choose the step-size  = 1/(n2), where  is the smoothness parameter of the underlying log-concave distribution (in particular here  = 1/2). The intuition for the choice of the step-size is as follows: the scaling in
inverse smoothness comes from the optimization literature, while the scaling in inverse dimension
squared comes from the analysis in the unconstrained case in Dalalyan [2014].

"Box" and by 0.2 x 2n for the "Box and Ball") as well as the clock time (in seconds) to terminate are

reported in the figure above. From these experiments it seems that LMC and H&R roughly compute

similar values for the volume (with H&R being slightly more accurate), and LMC is almost always a

bit faster. These results are encouraging, but much more extensive experiments are needed to decide

if LMC is indeed a competitor to H&R in practice.
