Abstract

Consider estimating an unknown, but structured (e.g. sparse, low-rank, etc.), signal x0  Rn from a vector y  Rm of measurements of the form yi = gi(aiT x0), where the ai's are the rows of a known measurement matrix A, and, g(*) is a (potentially unknown) nonlinear and random link-function. Such measurement
functions could arise in applications where the measurement device has nonlin-
earities and uncertainties. It could also arise by design, e.g., gi(x) = sign(x + zi), corresponds to noisy 1-bit quantized measurements. Motivated by the classical
work of Brillinger, and more recent work of Plan and Vershynin, we estimate x0 via solving the Generalized-LASSO, i.e., x := arg minx y - Ax0 2 + f (x) for some regularization parameter  > 0 and some (typically non-smooth) convex regularizer f (*) that promotes the structure of x0, e.g. 1-norm, nuclear-norm, etc. While this approach seems to naively ignore the nonlinear function g(*), both
Brillinger (in the non-constrained case) and Plan and Vershynin have shown that,
when the entries of A are iid standard normal, this is a good estimator of x0 up to a constant of proportionality , which only depends on g(*). In this work, we considerably strengthen these results by obtaining explicit expressions for x -x0 2, for the regularized Generalized-LASSO, that are asymptotically precise when m
and n grow large. A main result is that the estimation performance of the Gener-
alized LASSO with non-linear measurements is asymptotically the same as one whose measurements are linear yi = aiT x0 + zi, with  = Eg() and 2 = E(g() - )2, and,  standard normal. To the best of our knowledge,
the derived expressions on the estimation performance are the first-known precise
results in this context. One interesting consequence of our result is that the op-
timal quantizer of the measurements that minimizes the estimation error of the
Generalized LASSO is the celebrated Lloyd-Max quantizer.

1 Introduction
Non-linear Measurements. Consider the problem of estimating an unknown signal vector x0  Rn from a vector y = (y1, y2, . . . , ym)T of m measurements taking the following form:

yi = gi(aTi x0), i = 1, 2, . . . , m.

(1)

Here, each ai represents a (known) measurement vector. The gi's are independent copies of a (generically random) link function g. For instance, gi(x) = x + zi, with say zi being normally

distributed, recovers the standard linear regression setup with gaussian noise. In this paper, we are particularly interested in scenarios where g is non-linear. Notable examples include g(x) = sign(x) (or gi(x) = sign(x+zi)) and g(x) = (x)+, corresponding to 1-bit quantized (noisy) measurements, and, to the censored Tobit model, respectively. Depending on the situation, g might be known or unspecified. In the statistics and econometrics literature, the measurement model in (1) is popular under the name single-index model and several aspects of it have been well-studied, e.g. [4,5,14,15]1.
Structured Signals. It is typical that the unknown signal x0 obeys some sort of structure. For instance, it might be sparse, i.e.only a few k n, of its entries are non-zero; or, it might be that x0 = vec(X0), where X0  R nx n is a matrix of low-rank r n. To exploit this information it is typical to associate with the structure of x0 a properly chosen function f : Rn  R, which we refer to as the regularizer. Of particular interest are convex and non-smooth such regularizers, e.g. the 1-norm for sparse signals, the nuclear-norm for low-rank ones, etc. Please refer to [1, 6, 13] for further discussions.
An Algorithm for Linear Measurements: The Generalized LASSO. When the link function is linear, i.e. gi(x) = x + zi, perhaps the most popular way of estimating x0 is via solving the Generalized LASSO algorithm:

x := arg min
x

y - Ax

2 + f (x).

(2)

Here, A = [a1, a2, . . . , am]T  Rmxn is the known measurement matrix and  > 0 is a regularizer

parameter. This is often referred to as the 2-LASSO or the square-root-LASSO [3] to distinguish

from

the

instead.

Our results can be accustomed to this

latter version, but for concreteness, we restrict attention to (2) throughout. The acronym LASSO for

(2) was introduced in [22] for the special case of 1-regularization; (2) is a natural generalization

to other kinds of structures and includes the group-LASSO [25], the fused-LASSO [23] as special

cases. We often drop the term "Generalized" and refer to (2) simply as the LASSO.

One popular, measure of estimation performance of (2) is the squared-error

x - x0

2 2

.

Recently,

there have been significant advances on establishing tight bounds and even precise characterizations

of this quantity, in the presence of linear measurements [2, 10, 16, 18, 19, 21]. Such precise results

have been core to building a better understanding of the behavior of the LASSO, and, in particular,

on the exact role played by the choice of the regularizer f (in accordance with the structure of x0), by the number of measurements m, by the value of , etc.. In certain cases, they even provide us

with useful insights into practical matters such as the tuning of the regularizer parameter.

Using the LASSO for Non-linear Measurements?. The LASSO is by nature tailored to a linear
model for the measurements. Indeed, the first term of the objective function in (2) tries to fit Ax to the observed vector y presuming that this is of the form yi = aTi x0 + noise. Of course, no one stops us from continuing to use it even in cases where yi = g(aTi x0) with g being non-linear2. But, the question then becomes: Can there be any guarantees that the solution x of the Generalized LASSO
is still a good estimate of x0?

The question just posed was first studied back in the early 80's by Brillinger [5] who provided an-

swers in the case of solving (2) without a regularizer term. This, of course, corresponds to standard

Least Squares (LS). Interestingly, he showed that when the measurement vectors are Gaussian, then

the LS solution is a consistent estimate of x0, up to a constant of proportionality , which only depends on the link-function g. The result is sharp, but only under the assumption that the number

of measurements m grows large, while the signal dimension n stays fixed, which was the typical

setting of interest at the time. In the world of structured signals and high-dimensional measure-

ments, the problem was only very recently revisited by Plan and Vershynin [17]. They consider a

constrained version of the Generalized LASSO, in which the regularizer is essentially replaced by a

constraint, and derive upper bounds on its performance. The bounds are not tight (they involve ab-

solute constants), but they demonstrate some key features: i) the solution to the constrained LASSO

x is a good estimate of x0 up to the same constant of proportionality  that appears in Brillinger's

result. ii) Thus,

x - x0

2 2

is

a

natural

measure

of

performance.

iii) Estimation is possible even

with m < n measurements by taking advantage of the structure of x0.

1 The single-index model is a classical topic and can also be regarded as a special case of what is known

as sufficient dimension reduction problem. There is extensive literature on both subjects; unavoidably, we only

refer to the directly relevant works here.

2Note that the Generalized LASSO in (2) does not assume knowledge of g. All that is assumed is the

availability of the measurements yi. Thus, the link-function might as well be unknown or unspecified.

Here, gi(x) = sign(x + 0.3zi) with zi  N (0, 1). The unknown signal x0 is of dimension n = 768 and has 0.15n non-zero entries (see Sec. 2.2.2 for details). The different curves correspond to 0.75n and 1.2n
number of measurements, respectively. Simulation points are averages over 20 problem realizations.

1.1 Summary of Contributions

Inspired by the work of Plan and Vershynin [17], and, motivated by recent advances on the precise analysis of the Generalized LASSO with linear measurements, this paper extends these latter results to the case of non-linear mesaurements. When the measurement matrix A has entries i.i.d. Gaussian (henceforth, we assume this to be the case without further reference), and the estimation performance is measured in a mean-squared-error sense, we are able to precisely predict the asymptotic behavior of the error. The derived expression accurately captures the role of the link function g, the particular structure of x0, the role of the regularizer f , and, the value of the regularizer parameter . Further, it holds for all values of , and for a wide class of functions f and g.

Interestingly, our result shows in a very precise manner that in large dimensions, modulo the infor-

mation about the magnitude of x0, the LASSO treats non-linear measurements exactly as if they were scaled and noisy linear measurements with scaling factor  and noise variance 2 defined as

 := E[g()], and 2 := E[(g() - )2], for   N (0, 1),

(3)

where the expecation is with respect to both  and g. In particular, when g is such that  = 03, then,
the estimation performance of the Generalized LASSO with measurements of the form yi = gi(aTi x0) is asymptotically the same as if the measurements were rather of the form
yi = aTi x0 + zi, with , 2 as in (3) and zi standard gaussian noise.
Recent analysis of the squared-error of the LASSO, when used to recover structured signals from noisy linear observations, provides us with either precise predictions (e.g. [2, 20]), or in other cases, with tight upper bounds (e.g. [10, 16]). Owing to the established relation between non-linear and (corresponding) linear measurements, such results also characterize the performance of the LASSO in the presence of nonlinearities. We remark that some of the error formulae derived here in the general context of non-linear measurements, have not been previously known even under the prism of linear measurements. Figure 1 serves as an illustration; the error with non-linear measurements matches well with the error of the corresponding linear ones and both are accurately predicted by our analytic expression.
Under the generic model in (1), which allows for g to even be unspecified, x0 can, in principle, be estimated only up to a constant of proportionality [5, 15, 17]. For example, if g is uknown then any information about the norm x0 2 could be absorbed in the definition of g. The same is true when g(x) = sign(x), eventhough g might be known here. In these cases, what becomes important is the direction of x0. Motivated by this, and, in order to simplify the presentation, we have assumed throughout that x0 has unit Euclidean norm4, i.e. x0 2 = 1.
3This excludes for example link functions g that are even, but also some other not so obvious cases [11, Sec. 2.2]. For a few special cases, e.g. sparse recovery with binary measurements yi [24], different methodologies than the LASSO have been recently proposed that do not require  = 0.
4In [17, Remark 1.8], they note that their results can be easily generalized to the case when x0 2 = 1 by simply redifining g(x) = g( x0 2x) and accordingly adjusting the values of the parameters  and 2 in (3). The very same argument is also true in our case.

(4)

where  and 2 are same as in (3). Our result can be viewed as a generalization of the above in

several directions. First, we extend (4) to the regime where m/n =   (1, ) and both grow large

by showing that

(5)

Second, and most importantly, we consider solving the Generalized LASSO instead, to which LS is only a very special case. This allows versions of (5) where the error is finite even when  < 1 (e.g., see (8)). Note the additional challenges faced when considering the LASSO: i) x no longer has a closed-form expression, ii) the result needs to additionally capture the role of x0, f , and, . Motivated by Recent Work. Plan and Vershynin consider a constrained Generalized LASSO:

with y as in (1) and K  Rn some known set (not necessarily convex). In its simplest form, their

result shows that when m DK(x0) then with high probability,

when viewed from x0. For our purposes, it suffices to remark that if K is properly chosen, and,

if x0 is on the boundary of K, then DK(x0) is less than n. Thus, estimation is in principle is

possible with m < n measurements. The parameters  and  that appear in (7) are the same as in

(3) and  := E[(g() - )22]. Observe that, in contrast to (4) and to the setting of this paper,

the result in (7) is non-asymptotic. Also, it suggests the critical role played by  and . On the

other hand, (7) is only an upper bound on the error, and also, it suffers from unknown absolute

proportionality constants (hidden in ).

Moving the analysis into an asymptotic setting, our work expands upon the result of [17]. First, we

consider the regularized LASSO instead, which is more commonly used in practice. Most impor-

tantly, we improve the loose upper bounds into precise expressions. In turn, this proves in an exact manner the role played by  and 2 to which (7) is only indicative. For a direct comparison with

(7) we mention the following result which follows from our analysis (we omit the proof for brevity).

Assume K is convex, m/n =   (0, ), DK(x0)/n =   (0, 1] and n  . Also,  > .

Then, (7) yields an upper bound C / to the error, for some constant C > 0. Instead, we show

Precise Analysis of the LASSO With Linear Measurements. The first precise error formulae were established in [2, 10] for the 22-LASSO with 1-regularization. The analysis was based on the the Approximate Message Passing (AMP) framework [9]. A more general line of work studies

the problem using a recently developed framework termed the Convex Gaussian Min-max Theorem

(CGMT) [19], which is a tight version of a classical Gaussian comparison inequality by Gordon

[12]. The CGMT framework was initially used by Stojnic [18] to derive tight upper bounds on the

constrained LASSO with 1-regularization; [16] generalized those to general convex regularizers

and also to the

2-LASSO; the

2 2

-LASSO

was

studied

in

[21].

Those bounds hold for all values

of SNR, but they become tight only in the high-SNR regime. A precise error expression for all

values of SNR was derived in [20] for the 2-LASSO with 1-regularization under a gaussianity assumption on the distribution of the non-zero entries of x0. When measurements are linear, our Theorem 2.3 generalizes this assumption. Moreover, our Theorem 2.2 provides error predictions

for regularizers going beyond the 1-norm, e.g. 1,2-norm, nuclear norm, which appear to be novel. When it comes to non-linear measurements, to the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to

derive asymptotically precise results on the performance of any LASSO-type program.

2 Results

2.1 Modeling Assumptions Unknown structured signal. We let x0  Rn represent the unknown signal vector. We assume that x0 = x0/ x0 2, with x0 sampled from a probability density px0 in Rn. Thus, x0 is deterministically

4

of unit Euclidean-norm (this is mostly to simplify the presentation, see Footnote 4). Information
about the structure of x0 (and correspondingly of x0) is encoded in px0 . E.g., to study an x0 which is sparse, it is typical to assume that its entries are i.i.d. x0,i  (1 - )0 + qX0 , where   (0, 1) becomes the normalized sparsity level, qX0 is a scalar p.d.f. and 0 is the Dirac delta function5. Regularizer. We consider convex regularizers f : Rn  R.
Measurement matrix. The entries of A  Rmxn are i.i.d. N (0, 1).

Measurements and Link-function. We observe y = g(Ax0) where g is a (possibly random) map from Rm to Rm and g(u) = [g1(u1), . . . , gm(um)]T . Each gi is i.i.d. from a real valued random function g for which  and 2 are defined in (3). We assume that  and 2 are nonzero and bounded.

Asymptotics. We study a linear asymptotic regime. In particular, we consider a sequence of prob-
lem instances {x(0n), A(n), f (n), m(n)}nN indexed by n such that A(n)  Rmxn has entries i.i.d. N (0, 1), f (n) : Rn  R is proper convex, and, m := m(n) with m = n,   (0, ). We further
require that the following conditions hold:

(a) x(0n) is sampled from a probability density p(xn0) in Rn with one-dimensional marginals that are

independent of n and have bounded second moments. Furthermore, n-1

x(0n)

= 1.

(b) For any n  N and any x 2  C, it holds n-1/2f (x)  c1 and n-1/2 maxsf(n)(x) s 2  c2, for constants c1, c2, C  0 independent of n.

In (a), we used "-P" to denote convergence in probability as n  . The assumption x2 = 1 holds without loss of generality, and, is only necessary to simplify the presentation. In (b), f (x) denotes

the subdifferential of f at x. The condition itself is no more than a normalization condition on f .

Every such sequence {x(0n), A(n), f (n)}nN generates a sequence {x(0n), y(n)}nN where x(0n) := x(0n)/ x(0n) 2 and y(n) := g(n)(Ax0). When clear from the context, we drop the superscript (n).

2.2 Precise Error Prediction

Let {x(0n), A(n), f (n), y(n)}nN be a sequence of problem instances that satisfying all the conditions above. With these, define the sequence {x(n)}nN of solutions to the corresponding LASSO
problems for fixed  > 0:

x(n) := min 1 xn

y(n) - A(n)x 2 + f (n)(x) .

Theorem 2.1 (Non-linear=Linear). Consider the asymptotic setup of Section 2.1 and let Assumption 1 hold. Recall  and 2 as in (3) and let x be the minimizer of the Generalized LASSO in (9) for fixed  > 0 and for measurements given by (1). Further let xlin be the solution to the Generalized LASSO when used with linear measurements of the form ylin = A(x0) + z, where z has entries
i.i.d. standard normal. Then, in the limit of n  , with probability one,

x - x0

2 2

=

xlin - x0 22.

5Such models have been widely used in the relevant literature, e.g. [7,8,10]. In fact, the results here continue to hold as long as the marginal distribution of x0 converges to a given distribution (as in [2]).

Theorem 2.1 relates in a very precise manner the error of the Generalized LASSO under non-linear measurements to the error of the same algorithm when used under appropriately scaled noisy linear measurements. Theorem 2.2 below, derives an asymptotically exact expression for the error.

Theorem 2.2 (Precise Error Formula). Under the same assumptions of Theorem 2.1 and  := m/n,

Also, the optimal cost of the LASSO in (9) converges to the optimal cost of the program in (10).

Under the stated conditions, Theorem 2.2 proves that the limit of x - x0 2 exists and is equal to the unique solution of the optimization program in (10). Notice that this is a deterministic and
convex optimization, which only involves three scalar optimization variables. Thus, the optimal  can, in principle, be efficiently numerically computed. In many specific cases of interest, with some
extra effort, it is possible to yield simpler expressions for , e.g. see Theorem 2.3 below. The role of the normalized number of measurement  = m/n, of the regularizer parameter , and, that of g, through  and 2, are explicit in (10); the structure of x0 and the choice of the regularizer f are implicit in F . Figures 1-2 illustrate the accuracy of the prediction of the theorem in a number of
different settings. The proofs of both the Theorems are deferred to Appendix A. In the next sections,
we specialize Theorem 2.2 to the cases of sparse, group-sparse and low-rank signal recovery.

2.2.2 Sparse Recovery

Assume each entry x0,i, i = 1, . . . , n is sampled i.i.d. from a distribution

pX0 (x) = (1 - ) * 0(x) +  * qX0 (x),

(11)

where 0 is the delta Dirac function,   (0, 1) and qX0 a probability density function with second moment normalized to 1/ so that condition (a) of Section 2.1 is satisfied. Then, x0 = x0/ x0 2

is n-sparse on average and has unit Euclidean norm. Letting f (x) = x 1 also satisfies condition

(b). Let us now check Assumption 1. The Fenchel's conjugate of the 1-norm is simply the indicator

function of the  unit ball. Hence, without much effort,

Figures 1 and 2(a) validate the prediction of the theorem, for different signal distributions, namely

qX0 being Gaussian and Bernoulli, respectively. For the observe the two different regimes of operation, one for 

case of  crit

compressed ( < 1) measurements, and the other for   crit, precisely

as they are predicted by the theorem (see also [16, Sec. 8]). The special case of Theorem 2.3 for

which qX0 is Gaussian has been previously studied in [20]. Otherwise, to the best of our knowledge,

this is the first precise analysis result for the 2-LASSO stated in that generality. Analogous result,

but via different analysis tools, has only been known for the

2 2

as

appears

in

[2].

2.2.3 Group-Sparse Recovery

Let x0  Rn be composed of t non-overlapping blocks of constant size b each such that n = t * b. Each block [x0]i, i = 1, . . . , t is sampled i.i.d. from a probability density in Rb: pX0 (x) = (1 - ) * 0(x) +  * qX0 (x), x  Rb, where   (0, 1). Thus, x0 is t-block-sparse on average. We operate in the regime of linear measurements m/n =   (0, ). As is common we use the

1,2-norm to induce block-sparsity, i.e., f (x) =

t i=1

[x0]i

2; with this, (9) is often referred

to as group-LASSO in the literature [25]. It is not hard to show that Assumption 1 holds with

F (c1, c2, c3)

, where (x;  ) = x/

(

2.2.4 Low-rank Matrix Recovery

Let X0  Rdxd be an unknown matrix of rank r, in which case, x0 = vec(X0) with n = d2. Assume m/d2 =   (0, ) and r/d =   (0, 1). As usual in this setting, we consider nuclearnorm regularization; in particular, we choose f (x) = d X . Each subgradient S  f (X) then

satisfies S F  d in agreement with assumption (b) of Section 2.1. Furthermore, for this choice of

regularizer, we have

where (*; *) is as in (13), si(*) denotes the ith singular value of its argument and H  Rdxd has entries N (0, 1). If conditions are met such that the empirical distribution of the singular values of (the

this will be the case if d-1/2X0 = USVt, where U, V unitary matrices and S is a diagonal matrix

whose entries have a given marginal distribution with bounded moments (in particular, independent of d). We leave the details and the problem of (numerically) evaluating F for future work.

2.3 An Application to q-bit Compressive Sensing

2.3.1 Setup

Consider recovering a sparse unknown signal x0  Rn from scalar q-bit quantized linear measurements. Let t := {t0 = 0, t1, . . . , tL-1, tL = +} represent a (symmetric with respect to 0) set of decision thresholds and := { 1,  2, . . . ,  L} the corresponding representation points, such that L = 2q-1. Then, quantization of a real number x into q-bits can be represented as
L

Qq(x, , t) = sign(x)

i 1{ti-1 |x|ti } ,

i=1

where 1S is the indicator function of a set S. For example, 1-bit quantization with level corresponds to Q1(x, ) = * sign(x). The measurement vector y = [y1, y2 . . . , ym]T takes the form

yi = Qq(aTi x0, , t), i = 1, 2, . . . , m,

(16)

where aTi 's are the rows of a measurement matrix A  Rmxn, which is henceforth assumed i.i.d. standard Gaussian. We use the LASSO to obtain an estimate x of x0 as

x := arg min y - Ax 2 +  x 1.
x

(17)

Henceforth, we assume for simplicity that x0 2 = 1. Also, in our case,  is known since g = Qq is known; thus, is reasonable to scale the solution of (17) as -1x and consider the error quantity -1x - x0 2 as a measure of estimation performance. Clearly, the error depends (besides others)
on the number of bits q, on the choice of the decision thresholds t and on the quantization levels .

An interesting question of practical importance becomes how to optimally choose these to achieve

less error. As a running example for this section, we seek optimal quantization thresholds and

corresponding levels

(t, ) = arg min -1x - x0 2,
t,

(18)

while keeping all other parameters such as the number of bits q and of measurements m fixed.

2.3.2 Consequences of Precise Error Prediction

Theorem 2.1 shows that -1x - x0 2 = xlin - x0 2, where xlin is the solution to (17), but only,

2.3.3 An Algorithm for Finding Optimal Quantization Levels and Thresholds
In contrast to the initial problem in (18), the optimization involved in (19) is explicit in terms of the variables and t, but, is still hard to solve in general. Interestingly, we show in Appendix C that the popular Lloyd-Max (LM) algorithm can be an effective algorithm for solving (19), since the values to which it converges are stationary points of the objective in (19). Note that this is not a directly obvious result since the classical objective of the LM algorithm is minimizing the quantity E[ y - Ax0 22] rather than E[ -1x - x0 22].
