Abstract
In personalized recommendation systems, it is important to predict preferences of a user on items that have not been seen by that user yet. Similarly, in revenue management, it is important to predict outcomes of comparisons among those items that have never been compared so far. The MultiNomial Logit model, a popular discrete choice model, captures the structure of the hidden preferences with a low-rank matrix. In order to predict the preferences, we want to learn the underlying model from noisy observations of the low-rank matrix, collected as revealed preferences in various forms of ordinal data. A natural approach to learn such a model is to solve a convex relaxation of nuclear norm minimization. We present the convex relaxation approach in two contexts of interest: collaborative ranking and bundled choice modeling. In both cases, we show that the convex relaxation is minimax optimal. We prove an upper bound on the resulting error with finite samples, and provide a matching information-theoretic lower bound.
1 Introduction
In recommendation systems and revenue management, it is important to predict preferences on items that have not been seen by a user or predict outcomes of comparisons among those that have never been compared. Predicting such hidden preferences would be hopeless without further assumptions on the structure of the preference. Motivated by the success of matrix factorization models on collaborative filtering applications, we model hidden preferences with low-rank matrices to collaboratively learn preference matrices from ordinal data. This paper considers the following scenarios:
* Collaborative ranking. Consider an online market that collects each user's preference as a ranking over a subset of items that are `seen' by the user. Such data can be obtained by directly asking to compare some items, or by indirectly tracking online activities on which items are viewed, how much time is spent on the page, or how the user rated the items. In order to make personalized recommendations, we want a model which (a) captures how users who prefer similar items are also likely to have similar preferences on unseen items, (b) predicts which items a user might prefer, by learning from such ordinal data.
* Bundled choice modeling. Discrete choice models describe how a user makes decisions on what to purchase. Typical choice models assume the willingness to buy an item is independent of what else the user bought. In many cases, however, we make `bundled' purchases: we buy particular ingredients together for one recipe or we buy two connecting flights. One choice (the first flight) has a significant impact on the other (the connecting flight). In order to optimize the assortment (which flight schedules to offer) for maximum expected revenue, it is crucial to accurately predict the willingness of the consumers to purchase, based on past history. We consider a case where there are two types of products (e.g. jeans and shirts), and want (a) a model that captures such interacting preferences for pairs of items, one from each category; and (b) to predict the consumer's choice probabilities on pairs of items, by learning such models from past purchase history.

We use a discrete choice model known as MultiNomial Logit (MNL) model [1] (described in Section 2.1) to represent the preferences. In collaborative ranking context, MNL uses a low-rank matrix to represent the hidden preferences of the users. Each row corresponds to a user's preference over all the items, and when presented with a subset of items the user provides a ranking over those items, which is a noisy version of the hidden true preference. The low-rank assumption naturally captures the similarities among users and items, by representing each on a low-dimensional space. In bundled choice modeling context, the low-rank matrix now represents how pairs of items are matched. Each row corresponds to an item from the first category and each column corresponds to an item from the second category. An entry in the matrix represents how much the pair is preferred by a randomly chosen user from a pool of users. Notice that in this case we do not model individual preferences, but the preference of the whole population. The purchase history of the population is the record of which pair was chosen among a subsets of items that were presented, which is again a noisy version of the hidden true preference. The low-rank assumption captures the similarities and dis-similarities among the items in the same category and the interactions across categories. Contribution. A natural approach to learn such a low-rank model, from noisy observations, is to solve a convex relaxation of nuclear norm minimization (described in Section 2.2), since nuclear norm is the tightest convex surrogate for the rank function. We present such an approach for learning the MNL model from ordinal data, in two contexts: collaborative ranking and bundled choice modeling. In both cases, we analyze the sample complexity of the algorithm, and provide an upper bound on the resulting error with finite samples. We prove minimax-optimality of our approach by providing a matching information-theoretic lower bound (up to a poly-logarithmic factor). Technically, we utilize the Random Utility Model (RUM) [2, 3, 4] interpretation (outlined in Section 2.1) of the MNL model to prove both the upper bound and the fundamental limit, which could be of interest to analyzing more general class of RUMs. Related work. In the context of collaborative ranking, MNL models have been proposed to model partial rankings from a pool of users. Recently, there has been new algorithms and analyses of those algorithms to learn MNL models from samples, in the case when each user provides pair-wise comparisons [5, 6]. [6] proposes solving a convex relaxation of maximizing the likelihood over matrices with bounded nuclear norm. It is shown that this approach achieves statistically optimal generalization error rate, instead of Frobenius norm error that we analyze. Our analysis techniques are inspired by [5], which proposed the convex relaxation for learning MNL, but when the users provide only pair-wise comparisons. In this paper, we generalize the results of [5] by analyzing more general sampling models beyond pairwise comparisons. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the MNL model and propose a convex relaxation for learning the model, in the context of collaborative ranking. We provide theoretical guarantees for collaborative ranking in Section 3. In Section 4, we present the problem statement for bundled choice modeling, and analyze a similar convex relaxation approach.

2 Model and Algorithm
In this section, we present a discrete choice modeling for collaborative ranking, and propose an inference algorithm for learning the model from ordinal data.
2.1 MultiNomial Logit (MNL) model for comparative judgment In collaborative ranking, we want to model how people who have similar preferences on a subset of items are likely to have similar tastes on other items as well. When users provide ratings, as in collaborative filtering applications, matrix factorization models are widely used since the low-rank structure captures the similarities between users. When users provide ordered preferences, we use a discrete choice model known as MultiNomial Logit (MNL) [1] model that has a similar low-rank structure that captures the similarities between users and items.

Let  be the d1 x d2 dimensional matrix capturing the preference of d1users on d2 items, where the rows and columns correspond to users and items, respectively. Typically,  is assumed to be low-rank, having a rank r that is much smaller than the dimensions. However, in the following we allow a more general setting where  might be only approximately low rank. When a user i is presented with a set of alternatives Si  [d2], she reveals her preferences as a ranked list over those items. To simplify the notations we assume all users compare the same number k of items, but the analysis naturally generalizes to the case when the size might differ from a user to a user. Let vi,  Si denote the (random) -th best choice of user i. Each user gives a ranking, independent of other users' rankings, from

k

where with Si,  Si \ {vi,1, . . . , vi, -1} and Si,1  Si. For a user i, the i-th row of  represents the underlying preference vector of the user, and the more preferred items are more likely to be ranked higher. The probabilistic nature of the model captures the noise in the revealed preferences.

The random utility model (RUM), pioneered by [2, 3, 4], describes the choices of users as manifes-

tations of the underlying utilities. The MNL models is a special case of RUM where each decision

maker and each alternative are represented by a r-dimensional feature vectors ui and vj respectively,

sSuic, hthtehadtecisijio=n

ui, vj maker i

, resulting in a low-rank matrix. When ranks the alternatives according to their

presented with a set of alternatives random utility drawn from

Uij = ui, vj + ij ,

(2)

for item j, where ij follow the standard Gumbel distribution. Intuitively, this provides a justification for the MNL model as modeling the decision makers as rational being, seeking to maximize utility. Technically, this RUM interpretation plays a crucial role in our analysis, in proving restricted strong convexity in Appendix A.5 and also in proving fundamental limit in Appendix C.

There are a few cases where the Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation for RUM is tractable. One notable example is the Plackett-Luce (PL) model, which is a special case of the MNL model where  is rank-one and all users have the same features. PL model has been widely applied in econometrics [1], analyzing elections [7], and machine learning [8]. Efficient inference algorithms has been proposed [9, 10, 11], and the sample complexity has been analyzed for the MLE [12] and for the Rank Centrality [13]. Although PL is quite restrictive, in the sense that it assumes all users share the same features, little is known about inference in RUMs beyond PL. Recently, to overcome such a restriction, mixed PL models have been studied, where  is rank-r but there are only r classes of users and all users in the same class have the same features. Efficient inference algorithms with provable guarantees have been proposed by applying recent advances in tensor decomposition methods [14, 15], directly clustering the users [16, 17], or using sampling methods [18]. However, this mixture PL is still restrictive, and both clustering and tensor based approaches rely heavily on the fact that the distribution is a "mixture" and require additional incoherence assumptions on . For more general models, efficient inference algorithms have been proposed [19] but no performance guarantee is known for finite samples. Although the MLE for the general MNL model in (1) is intractable, we provide a polynomial-time inference algorithm with provable guarantees.

2.2 Nuclear norm minimization

Assuming  is well approximated by a low-rank matrix, we estimate  by solving the following convex relaxation given the observed preference in the form of ranked lists {(vi,1, . . . , vi,k)}i[d1].

for a low-rank solution that maximizes the likelihood. Nuclear norm minimization has been widely used in rank minimization problems [20], but provable guarantees typically exists only for quadratic loss function L() [21, 22]. Our analysis extends such analysis techniques to identify the conditions under which restricted strong convexity is satisfied for a convex loss function that is not quadratic.

3 Collaborative ranking from k-wise comparisons

We first provide background on the MNL model, and then present main results on the performance guarantees. Notice that the distribution (1) is independent of shifting each row of  by a constant. Hence, there is an equivalent class of  that gives the same distributions for the ranked lists:

[] = {A  Rd1xd2 | A =  + u 1T for some u  Rd1 } .

(5)

Since we can only estimate  up to this equivalent class, we search for the one whose rows sum to

zero, i.e. range of the

jun[dde2]rlyiin,jg

for all i  [d1]. Let   maxi,j1,j2 |ij1 - ij2 | denote such that when k items are compared, we always have

for all j  Si, all Si  [d2] satisfying |Si| = k and all i  [d1]. We do not make any assumptions on  other than that  = O(1) with respect to d1 and d2. The purpose of defining the dynamic range in this way is that we seek to characterize how the error scales with . Given this definition, we solve the optimization in (3) over

 = A  Rd1xd2 |||A|||  , and i  [d1] we have

Aij = 0 .

(7)

j [d2 ]

While in practice we do not require the  norm constraint, we need it for the analysis. For a related problem of matrix completion, where the loss L() is quadratic, either a similar condition on  norm is required or a different condition on incoherence is required.

3.1 Performance guarantee

We provide an upper bound on the resulting error of our convex relaxation, when a multi-set of

items Si presented to user i is drawn uniformly at random with replacement. Precisely, for a

given k, Si = {ji,1, . . . , ji,k} where ji, 's are independently drawn uniformly at random over

the d2 items. Further, if an item is sampled more than once, i.e. if some i and 1 = 2, then we assume that the user treats these two

same (with

resulting preference is therefore item), and distributed according

to (1). For example, if k = 3, it is possible to have Si = {ji,1 = 1, ji,2 = 1, ji,3 = 2}, in which case the resulting ranking can be (vi,1 = ji,1, vi,2 = ji,3, vi,3 = ji,2) with probability

(ei,1 )/(2 ei,1 + ei,2 ) x (ei,2 )/(ei,1 + ei,2 ). Such sampling with replacement is necessary

for the analysis, where we require independence in the choice of the items in Si in order to apply the symmetrization technique (e.g. [23]) to bound the expectation of the deviation (cf. Appendix A.5).

Similar sampling assumptions have been made in existing analyses on learning low-rank models

from noisy observations, e.g. [22]. Let d  (d1 + d2)/2, and let j() denote the j-th singular value of the matrix . Define

A proof is provided in Appendix A. The above bound shows a natural splitting of the error into two terms, one corresponding to the estimation error for the rank-r component and the second one corresponding to the approximation error for how well one can approximate  with a rank-r matrix. This bound holds for all values of r and one could potentially optimize over r. We show such results in the following corollaries. Corollary 3.1 (Exact low-rank matrices). Suppose  has rank at most r. Under the hypotheses of Theorem 1, solving the optimization (3) with the choice of the regularization parameter   [4800, c00] achieves with probability at least 1 - 2d-3 - d-2 3,

When  is a rank-r matrix, then the degrees of freedom in representing  is r(d1 + d2) - r2 =

O(r(d1 + d2)). The above theorem shows that the total number of samples, which is (k d1), needs to

scale as O(rd1(log d) + rd2 (log d)2(log 2d)4 in order to achieve an arbitrarily small error. This is

only poly-logarithmic factor larger than the degrees of freedom. In Section 3.2, we provide a lower

bound on the error directly, that matches the upper bound up to a logarithmic factor.

The dependence on the dynamic range , however, is sub-optimal. It is expected that the error increases with , since the  scales as , but the exponential dependence in the bound seems to be a weakness of the analysis, as seen from numerical experiments in the right panel of Figure 1. Although the error increase with , numerical experiments suggests that it only increases at most linearly. However, tightening the scaling with respect to  is a challenging problem, and such suboptimal dependence is also present in existing literature for learning even simpler models, such as the Bradley-Terry model [13] or the Plackett-Luce model [12], which are special cases of the MNL model studied in this paper. A practical issue in achieving the above rate is the choice of , since the dynamic range  is not known in advance. Figure 1 illustrates that the error is not sensitive to the choice of  for a wide range.

Another issue is that the underlying matrix might not be exactly low rank. It is more realistic to assume that it is approximately low rank. Following [22] we formalize this notion with " q-ball" of matrices defined as

Bq(q)  {  Rd1xd2 |

|j()|q  q} .

j [min{d1 ,d2 }]

(10)

When q = 0, this is a set of rank-0 matrices. For q  (0, 1], this is set of matrices whose singular values decay relatively fast. Optimizing the choice of r in Theorem 1, we get the following result.

Corollary 3.2 (Approximately low-rank matrices). Suppose   Bq(q) for some q  (0, 1] and q > 0. Under the hypotheses of Theorem 1, solving the optimization (3) with the choice of the regularization parameter   [4800, c00] achieves with probability at least 1 - 2d-3,

This is a strict generalization of Corollary 3.1. For q = 0 and 0 = r, this recovers the exact low-rank estimation bound up to a factor of two. For approximate low-rank matrices in an q-ball, we lose in the error exponent, which reduces from one to (2 - q)/2. A proof of this Corollary is provided in Appendix B. The left panel of Figure 1 confirms the scaling of the error rate as predicted by Corollary 3.1. The lines merge to a single line when the sample size is rescaled appropriately. We make a choice of  = (1/2) (log d)/(kd2), This choice is independent of  and is smaller than proposed in Theorem 1. We generate random rank-r matrices of dimension d x d, where  = U V T with U  Rdxr and V  Rdxr entries generated i.i.d from uniform distribution over [0, 1]. Then the

3.2 Information-theoretic lower bound for low-rank matrices

For a polynomial-time algorithm of convex relaxation, we gave in the previous section a bound on the achievable error. We next compare this to the fundamental limit of this problem, by giving a lower bound on the achievable error by any algorithm (efficient or not). A simple parameter counting argument indicates that it requires the number of samples to scale as the degrees of freedom i.e., kd1  r(d1 + d2), to estimate a d1 x d2 dimensional matrix of rank r. We construct an appropriate packing over the set of low-rank matrices with bounded entries in  defined as (7), and show that no algorithm can accurately estimate the true matrix with high probability using the generalized Fano's inequality. This provides a constructive argument to lower bound the minimax error rate, which in turn establishes that the bounds in Theorem 1 is sharp up to a logarithmic factor, and proves no other algorithm can significantly improve over the nuclear norm minimization. Theorem 2. Suppose  has rank r. Under the described sampling model, for large enough d1 and d2  d1, there is a universal numerical constant c > 0 such that

where the infimum is taken over all measurable functions over the observed ranked lists {(vi,1, . . . , vi,k)}i[d1].
A proof of this theorem is provided in Appendix C. The term of primary interest in this bound is the first one, which shows the scaling of the (rescaled) minimax rate as r(d1 + d2)/(kd1) (when d2  d1), and matches the upper bound in (8). It is the dominant term in the bound whenever the number of samples is larger than the degrees of freedom by a logarithmic factor, i.e., kd1 > r(d1 +d2) log d, ignoring the dependence on . This is a typical regime of interest, where the sample size is comparable to the latent dimension of the problem. In this regime, Theorem 2 establishes that the upper bound in Theorem 1 is minimax-optimal up to a logarithmic factor in the dimension d.

4 Choice modeling for bundled purchase history

In this section, we use the MNL model to study another scenario of practical interest: choice modeling from bundled purchase history. In this setting, we assume that we have bundled purchase history data from n users. Precisely, there are two categories of interest with d1 and d2 alternatives in each category respectively. For example, there are d1 tooth pastes to choose from and d2 tooth brushes to choose from. For the i-th user, a subset Si  [d1] of alternatives from the first category is presented along with a subset Ti  [d2] of alternatives from the second category. We use k1 and k2 to denote the number of alternatives presented to a single user, i.e. k1 = |Si| and k2 = |Ti|, and we assume that the number of alternatives presented to each user is fixed, to simplify notations. Given these sets of alternatives, each user makes a `bundled' purchase and we use (ui, vi) to denote the bundled pair of alternatives (e.g. a tooth brush and a tooth paste) purchased by the i-th user. Each user makes a choice of the best alternative, independent of other users's choices, according to the MNL model as

P {(ui, vi) = (j1, j2)} =

ej1 ,j2 ej1Si,j2Ti j1,j2

,

(13)

for all j1  Si and j2  Ti. The distribution (13) is independent of shifting all the values of  by a

constant. Hence, there is an equivalent class of  that gives the same distribution for the choices:

[]  {A  Rd1xd2 | A =  + c11T for some c  R} . Since we can only estimate  up to

this equivalent class, we search for the one that sum to zero, i.e.

Assuming  is well approximate by a low-rank matrix, we solve the following convex relaxation, given the observed bundled purchase history {(ui, vi, Si, Ti)}i[n]:

We provide an upper bound on the error achieved by our convex relaxation, when the multi-set

This corollary shows that the number of samples n needs to scale as O(r(d1 + d2) log d) in order to achieve an arbitrarily small error. This is only a logarithmic factor larger than the degrees of freedom. We provide a fundamental lower bound on the error, that matches the upper bound up to a logarithmic factor. For approximately low-rank matrices in an 1-ball as defined in (10), we show an upper bound on the error, whose error exponent reduces from one to (2 - q)/2.

Since the proof is almost identical to the proof of Corollary 3.2 in Appendix B, we omit it. Theorem 4. Suppose  has rank r. Under the described sampling model, there is a universal constant c > 0 such that that the minimax rate where the infimum is taken over all measurable functions over the observed purchase history {(ui, vi, Si, Ti)}i[n] is lower bounded by

See Appendix E.1 for the proof. The first term is dominant, and when the sample size is comparable to the latent dimension of the problem, Theorem 3 is minimax optimal up to a logarithmic factor.

5 Discussion
We presented a convex program to learn MNL parameters from ordinal data, motivated by two scenarios: recommendation systems and bundled purchases. We take the first principle approach of identifying the fundamental limits and also developing efficient algorithms matching those fundamental trade offs. There are several remaining challenges. (a) Nuclear norm minimization, while polynomial-time, is still slow. We want first-order methods that are efficient with provable guarantees. The main challenge is providing a good initialization to start such non-convex approaches. (b) For simpler models, such as the PL model, more general sampling over a graph has been studied. We want analytical results for more general sampling. (c) The practical use of the model and the algorithm needs to be tested on real datasets on purchase history and recommendations.
